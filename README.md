# Interactive Inspector | WebGL Javascript

This repo inherits much of the concepts from [this repo](https://github.com/cs-isamiul/Interactive-Anatomy-Visualization-Demo),
but took a different implementation and is built specifically for running on browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Dev Log 

* July 9th 

  Modified the file handling and added localhost development support. 

  Run the python script and it should offer a localhost port to test the app.  

* July 7th 

  Updated the model and started to load the rock scene. 

  Switched the coding method from procedual to object oriented. 

* July 26th
  
  Updated file structure and added the icon. Javascript files are now separated from
  the main HTML, so does the CSS.
